## Overview

This repository contains a basic setup for an AI assistant for a generic e-commerce company. The assistant is designed to handle customer inquiries about order status, return policies, and request human representative contact.

## Features

- **Order Status**: Retrieve and display the status of a specific order.
- **Human Representative**: Collect user contact details for follow-up by a human representative.
- **Return Policy**: Store and retrieve information about the company's return and refund policy using a vector database.

## Prerequisites

- **Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.10 or later installed.
- **OpenAI API Key**: Obtain an API key from OpenAI.
- **Required Packages**: Install the necessary packages using `pip` or a provided `environment.yaml` file.

2. **Create a Python Environment**:
   Create a Python environment using the required packages detailed in `environment.yaml`:
