# AI Customer Service Assistant

## Overview

This repository contains a basic setup for an AI assistant for a generic e-commerce company. The assistant is designed to handle customer inquiries about order status, return policies, and request human representative contact.

## Features

- **Order Status**: Retrieve and display the status of a specific order.
- **Human Representative**: Collect user contact details for follow-up by a human representative.
- **Return Policy**: Store and retrieve information about the company's return and refund policy using a vector database.

## Prerequisites

- **Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.10 or later installed.
- **OpenAI API Key**: Obtain an API key from OpenAI.
- **Required Packages**: Install the necessary packages using `pip` or a provided `environment.yaml` file.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-customer-service-assistant.git
   cd ai-customer-service-assistant
   ```
   
2. **Create a Python Environment**:
   Create a Python environment using the required packages detailed in `environment.yaml`:
   ```
   conda env create -f environment.yaml
   ```
   Or manually install the necessary package:
   ```
   pip install openai
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Main Script**:

2. **Interact with the Assistant**:
